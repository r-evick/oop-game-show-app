 OOP Game Show App


This is a word guess app that generates a random phrase that users will try to guess by selecting letters from a keyboard.

When the user selects a letter it will either appear in the phrase to show it was a correct letter in the phrase, or a heart will be deducted to show a life has been lost and the letter was not in the phrase.

The player will continue to guess until either the complete phrase is shown (game won), or all 5 lives have been used (game loss).


Added functions:

1. Users can use their physical keyboard instead of the on-screen keyboard to enter letters.
2. The enter button can be used to start a game instead of clicking the 'Start Game' button.
3. Replaced static hearts with animated gif ones.
4. Background color changes based off how many misses user has.
5. Toggle button created to play or pause background music.
